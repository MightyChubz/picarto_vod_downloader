# Notice
This program will no longer work and I have no plans of updating it. Picarto made an update a while back that will hide the M3U8 link that this program grabbed until after the page has loaded. This is probably done through a JS script, or a kind of server-side processing. Since this was a generic and simple client that had no intentions of having intense depth for anything like that (other than to be a tool to save VODs), I have decided to not update and fix the issue. 

# Picarto VOD Downloader
This is a basic downloader made for downloading Picarto VODs. It is meant to be faster than [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl "youtube-dl") by being meant only for Picarto, while youtube-dl is meant for a wide range of sites.

## Requirements 
- Have FFmpeg installed and in your `PATH` (just have ffmpeg installed for linux users.)
